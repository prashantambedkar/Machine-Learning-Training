# Machine Learning Engineer Training

This repository contains my hands-on work while learning machine learning through the Udemy course  
**Machine Learning A–Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize (2025)** by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves.

The purpose of this repository is to reinforce machine learning fundamentals through implementation. It focuses on translating course concepts into working code, modifying examples, and experimenting beyond the provided material where possible.

This is a learning-focused repository, not a production-grade ML system.

## What This Repository Covers

- Core machine learning algorithms
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Experiments based on course concepts
- Notes and observations from implementations

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

(Additional libraries will be added only if and when they are actually used.)

## Status

Ongoing. Code quality, structure, and depth will improve as I progress through the course and gain more experience.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for learning and experimentation. Some implementations are based on guided course material and are not optimized for production use.
